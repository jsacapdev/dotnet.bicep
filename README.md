# Dotnet/Azure CLI in a DevContainer

A base devcontainer that I have found useful for building out either:

- Application repositories
- (Azure) Infrastructure as code repositories

Instead of documenting everything (and it getting out of date) please feel free to open in a devcontainer and take a look around, or set-up a deployment pipeline in Azure Dev Ops.

If you are working with [Azure Functions](https://github.com/jsacapdev/functions.bicep) I have another repository that may also be of help.

Any issues, please raise an issue and I will try and help.
